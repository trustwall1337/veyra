# Step 10e — Extend `evidence-report` agent + new readiness rules

**Status:** not started
**Maps to:** `PHASE_2_PLAN §7 Task 8`, §5.2, §5.3
**Produces:** agent extension (`src/agents/evidence-report/readiness.ts`, `controls.ts`)
**Depends on:** 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d
**Executed by:** `/new-agent` extension pass
**Verification:** `readiness.ts` unit tests for each new rule; `--fail-on-blocker` exits non-zero on the new path

## Goal

The single place where Phase 2 promotion happens. Take upstream agents' corroboration metadata + `active-validation-results.json` + `cleanup-proof.json` → upgrade classifications and readiness statuses per `§5.2` and `§5.3`.

## What lands

- Update `src/agents/evidence-report/controls.ts` to add entries for any Phase 2 controls that didn't exist in Phase 1, AND add `phase_2_active_supported: boolean` metadata so the planner test in step 07 can validate the catalog.
- Update `src/agents/evidence-report/readiness.ts` with the new Phase 2 rules in this exact order. **Active evidence (`proven_denial` / `proven_allowed`) is evaluated BEFORE heuristic-based blocker rules**, because direct evidence trumps heuristic strength. Otherwise, a `proven_denial` on a high-confidence `likely_issue` would be mis-classified as a blocker even though the control was actively shown to deny the test actor.
  1. Any `ActiveValidationResult.outcome === 'proven_allowed'` for a sensitive control → promote underlying finding from `likely_issue` to `confirmed_issue + fix_before_launch` → `readiness_status: launch_blocker` (Phase 2, new — direct evidence). Wins over rules 3/4 below.
  2. **`proven_in_sandbox` requires the full required-scenario set**, NOT a single denial. A control is `proven_in_sandbox` if and only if: (a) every scenario in `controls.ts[control_id].required_scenario_set` produced outcome `proven_denial`, (b) `cleanup-proof.json.residual_count === 0`, (c) no scenario for that control produced `proven_allowed`. A single `proven_denial` is recorded as "tested scenario denied" in the report — NOT as a proven control. (Phase 2, new — direct evidence; wins over rules 3/4 only when the full set is satisfied.)
  3. Any `confirmed_issue + fix_before_launch` (without active contradiction) → `launch_blocker` (Phase 1, unchanged).
  4. Any `likely_issue + evidence_strength: high + fix_before_launch` (without active contradiction) → `launch_blocker` (Phase 1, unchanged).
  5. Any `coverage_gap` AND no contradicting evidence → `needs_review`.
  6. Otherwise → `evidence_present`.
- Update `--fail-on-blocker` exit-code logic: non-zero iff any control card has `readiness_status: launch_blocker`. Phase 1 step 14 covered this; step 10e extends the rule set without changing the gate semantics.

## Done when

- Unit tests cover each rule independently:
  - `proven_allowed` on a `cc-11-6` finding → `confirmed_issue` + `launch_blocker`
  - `proven_denial` on EVERY scenario in `cc-11-5.required_scenario_set` + `residual_count: 0` → `proven_in_sandbox` **even if the underlying heuristic strength was `high`** (rule-2-wins-over-rule-4 test, full-coverage variant)
  - `proven_denial` on ONLY ONE of the required scenarios → readiness stays at the Phase 1 baseline (NOT `proven_in_sandbox`); the partial denial is recorded as "tested scenario denied" in the report's `active_validation_results` but does not upgrade readiness
  - `proven_denial` on `cc-11-5` BUT `residual_count: 5` → NOT `proven_in_sandbox` (cleanup failed)
  - `proven_allowed` AND `proven_denial` both present for same control → `confirmed_issue + launch_blocker` (rule 1 wins, contradiction noted in uncertainty_notes)
  - `inconclusive` outcome → no promotion, control stays at the Phase 1 classification
- Integration test: full fixture run with Mode B → `control-cards.json` shows the expected readiness state per control.
- `--fail-on-blocker` test: induced `proven_allowed` → non-zero exit.
- Phase 1 readiness rules unchanged for Mode A scans.

## Guardrails

- Promotion path is exclusively rule 1 above (a `proven_allowed` outcome). AI never promotes. Heuristics never promote on their own.
- `proven_in_sandbox` requires (a) `proven_denial` on the FULL `required_scenario_set` for the control, (b) `residual_count: 0`, (c) no `proven_allowed` for any scenario. Partial denials are not upgrades. Cleanup failure means no `proven_in_sandbox` claims — per `§11.3`.
- `readiness_status` is computed deterministically. No AI input. No timestamps. Same upstream artifacts → same readiness output.
- Agent reads from artifact store only. No imports from sibling agents.
